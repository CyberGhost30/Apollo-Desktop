# As the name says, rolling and testing Apollo for 1st version release, this is for Apollo default.
Apollo Default is bare bone DE with a blank dark orange desktop (or maybe it own default wallpaper?) with windows 3.11 like behaviors: minimize programs turn into icons on the desktop (no putting files on the desktop at all, but can still put files in the desktop folder which both orbits will make use of) but with a very small bar at the bottom right side of the screen containing notification icons, time and date, and power options. Made to feel like openbox / fluxbox DEâ€™s and good for really old computers / laptops.
